                    For college, I decided to stay in Montana and play soccer for Montana State University. 
                     This was a four year school at the NCAA D2 level. Out of the 68 games played in those four years, I started a total of 66 of them.
                    I accumulated a total of 5,214 minutes played in those four year. During that time I also earned myself numerous awards.
                    I was named a tournament MVP my junior year and my senior year I was named Honorable Mention defender from my entire conference.
                    Playing and playing well at a competitive college level was one of my proudest accomplishments.

                        While playing at the college level made me extremely proud, I did not stop there!
                        After I graduated from MSUB, I moved to Rome, Italy where I played for an academy and signed 
                        with a Professional football club. That experience was truly a dream come true!
