        <h1>Courteney Abroad</h1>
        Below are a few of my favorite photo's that I have captured while traveling. During my junior year of Undergrad, I was lucky
        enough to have the opportunity to study abroad. I spent an entire semester studying at the University of Winchester in Winchester, England.
        During that semester I took every free weekend to travel. After I graduated college I again decided to go abroad where I lived in Rome, Italy.
        In my 24 short years of life, I have visited 15 different countries!
